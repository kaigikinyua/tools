Ideal One:
    Take a big chunk of data and look for another similar arrangement and 
    map to a certain hash
    -the bigger the chunk and the more frequent the repetition the better the 
        compression
    -hard to find repetition chunks

Innovating
    An algorithm that chooses the best performant compression method based on the 
    number of repetitions


    math:
        number of characters = x
        length of string = l
        possible combinations = x^()
